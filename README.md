Teaching tasks for friends
======
The repository contains a collection of tasks to help challenge friends who want to get started in a programming language (focus is on Python and JavaScript)

Some of the assignments and tasks are copied from the [@TelerikAcademy](https://github.com/TelerikAcademy) github organization and modified according to the needs of the language that is targeted.
